# Kasflow ðŸ¤–
Kasflow (or _Cashflow_) is an AI-powered Telegram bot for personal expense tracking, reporting and insights.

```
Disclaimer:
- For personal use only, might not suitable for large records (backed by SQLite database).
- Currently no managed hosting solution so you have to host and run yourself.
- Feel free to fork and extend to suite your need. Contributions to this project are always welcomed.
```

**ðŸ‘‰ Features:**
- Record your expenses in natural language (tested on English and Indonesian).
- Multi-turn conversations.
- Can be added to Group (for group expense tracking).
- Each user and group expense records are stored in separate database.
- Telegram command to list all expenses.

**ðŸ‘‰ Why built this?**

Recently I stumbled upon [Langgraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/why-langgraph/) for AI application development. Keen to try it out myself and to build a **real project** that I'll actually use is the most fun way to learn. Develop an expense tracking bot on Telegram platform seems like good and viable idea.

**ðŸ‘‰ Limitations:**
- Tested only on conversation in English and Indonesian. Let me know it it works with your language too.
- Tested only on `GPT-4.1-*` models, may or may not work on other models and providers.
- Limited Telegram commands (more added soon).
- For simplicity it uses SQLite, might not scale well.
- Uses very basic RAG system, might not perform well on large expense records.

**ðŸ‘‰ Tech stack:**
- [Python Telegram Bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/)
- [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/why-langgraph/) (LLM workflows orchestration)
- OpenAI API (LLM provider)
- SQLite (expense records storage)
